## Introduction
Welcome to the Retail Sales and Customer Demographics Dataset! This synthetic dataset has been meticulously crafted to simulate a dynamic retail environment, providing an ideal playground for those eager to sharpen their data analysis skills through exploratory data analysis (EDA). With a focus on retail sales and customer characteristics, this dataset invites you to unravel intricate patterns, draw insights, and gain a deeper understanding of customer behavior.
This dataset is a snapshot of a fictional retail landscape, capturing essential attributes that drive retail operations and customer interactions. It includes key details such as Transaction ID, Date, Customer ID, Gender, Age, Product Category, Quantity, Price per Unit, and Total Amount. The attributes enable a multifaceted exploration of sales trends, demographic influences, and purchasing behaviors.

## Data Source
The dataset used in this project is sourced from Kaggle (kaggle datasets download -d mohammadtalib786/retail-sales-dataset)

## Problem Statement/Objectives: 
This project aims to unravel Retail Trends by diving into Sales Patterns and Customer Profiles to improve Sales performance by answering the following questions.
1.  How does customer' age and gender influence their purchasing behavior?
2.  Are there discernible patterns in sales across different time periods?
3.  Which product categories hold the highest appeal among customers?
4.  What are the relationships between age, spending, and product preferences?
5.  How do customers adapt their shopping habits during seasonal trends?
6.  Are there distinct purchasing behaviors based on the number of items bought per transaction?
7.  What insights can be gleaned from the distribution of product prices within each category?

## Tools Used
Power BI is used for this project. It is a readily available visualization software that provides a comprehensive platform for data cleaning, analysis, and visualization.

## Data Importation
The dataset was provided in Excel format; hence the extraction was straightforward. In Data Ribbon, simply click on “Excel Workbook”, then Open>Browse and navigate to the location where the dataset is stored, then click Browse and find your dataset.

## Cleaning and Analyzing Procedures
The dataset was systematically reviewed for accuracy and completeness in Power query editor. While there were no missing values. To expand the dataset’s analytical capabilities, new columns, such as ‘Age Group, Month, and Season’ were generated using DAX functions.

## Analysis Summary
### How does customer' age and gender influence their purchasing behavior?
![](https://github.com/Pareto01/Retail-Sales-Performance-Analysis/blob/main/Retail%201.PNG)

The customer age was categorized into 5 segments having the age-group 18-24, 25-34, 35-44, 45-54, 55, and above. It was observed that Sales revenue differs across age groups. The 45-54 age group stands out as the highest contributor to sales revenue among the specified age ranges, with revenue reaching $97.2k, and the lowest in the 18-24 age group ($90.2k).
The peak in the 45-54 age group suggests that individuals within this demographic may exhibit higher spending power or engage in more substantial purchases compared to other age groups.
The notable peak in sales revenue within the middle age groups (25-34, 35-44, and 45-54) indicates that customers in these age ranges contribute significantly to overall sales.

### Are there discernible patterns in sales across different time periods? 
![](https://github.com/Pareto01/Retail-Sales-Performance-Analysis/blob/main/Retail%202.PNG)

October 2023 and January 2024 amounted to the highest sales of 126k and 1.5k respectively.
Sum of Sales trended down between January 2023 and January 2024 with a drop of 106,970.

### Which product categories hold the highest appeal among customers?
![](https://github.com/Pareto01/Retail-Sales-Performance-Analysis/blob/main/Retail%203.PNG)

Electronic products accounted for the highest-selling category, generating 157k in sales revenue, while clothing and beauty products closely followed with 156k and 144k, respectively.
The increased revenue generated by sales of electronic devices indicates that this category is highly favored by consumers. Consumers might be more likely to spend money on gadgets, electronics, or related goods. 
Competitive sales revenues indicate the significant popularity of clothing and cosmetic products. Consumers are very interested in beauty and fashion-related products.

### How do customers adapt their shopping habits during seasonal trends?
![](https://github.com/Pareto01/Retail-Sales-Performance-Analysis/blob/main/Retail%204.PNG)

There exist a varying sales revenue across different seasons, with the highest observed during the winter (126k) and the lowest during autumn (105k),
Given that winter delivers the largest sales revenue, customers may likely change their buying habits and make larger purchases during this time of year. Spending during the holidays, winter fashion, or certain product advertising may have an impact on this.

### Are there distinct purchasing behaviors based on the number of items bought per transaction?
![](https://github.com/Pareto01/Retail-Sales-Performance-Analysis/blob/main/Retail%206.PNG)

With transactions of 522, 445, 534, 518, and 495 for price per unit categories of 25, 30, 50, 300, and 500, respectively, the number of products purchased per transaction varies across different price per unit categories. 
The number of transactions for the higher individual price per unit (300 and 500) products are quite close to those of the lesser priced items (25, 30, 50). This suggests that buyers are still prepared to part up their money for more expensive goods.

### What insights can be gleaned from the distribution of product prices within each category?
![](https://github.com/Pareto01/Retail-Sales-Performance-Analysis/blob/main/Retail%207.PNG)

Electronics has the highest total price at ₦62.2k, indicating that products in this category are either more expensive or more numerous compared to others. Clothing follows closely with a total price of ₦61.2k, suggesting moderate pricing or a large number of products in the category. Beauty, with the lowest total price of ₦56.5k, may have fewer products or lower-priced items, presenting an opportunity to expand or adjust pricing to improve its performance.

## Recommendation and Conclusion
•	It is important to consistently keep track of sales trends over time so that strategies can be adjusted to meet the changing market conditions. Patterns have the potential to shift, and by staying well-informed, one can make swift and flexible decisions.
•	The knowledge gained from observing seasonal trends can be used to improve our inventory management and make more accurate demand forecasts. By doing so, we can prevent situations where we run out of stock during times of high demand, and also reduce the amount of excess inventory we have during slower periods.

•	The unchanging numbers of transactions in various price categories indicate that customers might make both smaller, more frequent purchases for cheaper items and occasional purchases for pricier ones. This could imply possibilities for combined purchases or package offers.
•	Promotions targeting items priced at 50 per unit can yield a higher response, therefore marketing messages and promotions based on purchasing behaviors can be tailored to enhance the effectiveness of promotional efforts.

•	By identifying cost-effective manufacturing processes, businesses can explore opportunities to optimize pricing strategies and negotiate better supplier deals, ultimately improving profit margins.
